        <h1>My SDRJMUN Page</h1>
        <p>I joined SDRJMUN late; my 8th grade year. However, as a delegate, I did quite <ins>well.</ins> I received the distinctive <i>Raporteur</i> and although I failed to secure gavel, I have received <ins>every other possible award</ins> during the two years I participated as delegate.</p>
        <p>Now however, I get to <ins>staff,</ins> which is just as fun. I served as the <i>Page</i> for RSC last year, and I will continue onto the <ins>WHO</ins> this year.</p>
