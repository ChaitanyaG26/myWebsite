        <h1>My ARC Page</h1>
        <p>At ARC, I worked as a Mechanical Designer to create a basic claw mechanism to pick up certain items, and as a reserve programmer.</p>
        <p>I also served as the Treasurer, and I actually continue to do so, being somewhat vital in coordinating purchases for our two teams.</p>
